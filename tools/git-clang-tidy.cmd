rem Wrapper so `git clang-tidy` works from native Windows (cmd/PowerShell),
rem where shebang lines aren't honored. Git for Windows finds this via
rem PATHEXT when resolving the `git-clang-tidy` subcommand. On Linux/macOS/
rem WSL/Git Bash, the sibling `git-clang-tidy` file's shebang is used
rem instead, and this .cmd file is simply ignored.
